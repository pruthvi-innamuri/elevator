# Elevator Simulation

## Technologies Used: HTML, Javascript

## Project Scope:

Build a simple two-elevator system for n stories. The system can pick up guests and drop them off at any floor, but must achieve this in the most efficient way possible. The doors at an elevator's current level can be held open indefinitely or closed.


## Setup:
1. Download files in a folder.
2. Open html file.
3. Open up console output.
4. Test different floors and see the simulation run in the console.
